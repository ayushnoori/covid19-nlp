### Methodology {data-width=600}

Our project aimed to characterize the public opinion of the COVID-19 pandemic by applying machine learning on COVID-related tweets. Our methodology is detailed below:

1. We queried the pre-curated dataset of COVID-related tweets published by [Chen et al.](https://doi.org/10.2196/19273) in *JMIR* for those tweets posted on July 1st, 2021. A total of 2,996,979 tweets were identified.

2. We filtered this initial dataset for tweets which were written in the English language and which were *not* retweets (i.e., were original content). The resulting 540,642 tweets were hydrated in Python using the Twitter API.

3. The 511,675 successfully hydrated tweets were parsed from JSON/HTML and cleaned in R, followed by feature extraction (e.g., hashtags, URLs, replies, retweets, location, etc.). 

4. Finally, we used natural language processing tools including structural topic modeling to derive aggregate features from our dataset.

Analyses were performed in Python and R. All code is available via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ayushnoori/covid19-nlp).

### Topic Modeling {data-width=400}

Tweet preprocessing was performed using a wrapper to the `tm` package. Briefly, extra white space was stripped; numbers, stop words, punctuation, and low-frequency terms were removed; and words were stemmed using snowball stemmers.

After constructing the tweet term matrix and the vocabulary index of words in the corpus, we then used the [`stm` package](http://www.structuraltopicmodel.com/) to estimate a structural topic model (STM) using semi-collapsed variational EM. STMs permit the study of interaction betweeen tweet-level covariates (from feature extraction) and topical prevalence and/or content. We use spectral initialization and applied the algorithm of Lee and Mimno (2014) to estimate the number of topics. A maximum of 100 EM iterations were permitted; if convergence was not met at this point, the model was discarded.

The resulting topics were examined, and topics of interest were selected for further analysis. For each topic, top tweets ranked by the MAP estimate of the topic's theta value (which captures the modal estimate of the proportion of word tokens assigned to the topic under the model) were identified. Representative tweets are displayed [here](#topics).

# COVID-19 Twitter NLP
### *HDAG Data Science Fellowship*

This research project aims to identify the most prevalent COVID-19 questions shared in public opinion by applying machine learning tools to public datasets of COVID-related tweets. Rather than access the Twitter COVID-19 streaming endpoint directly, we plan to use the pre-curated [USC JIMR Dataset](https://publichealth.jmir.org/2020/2/e19273/#ref24). Aggregate Twitter content may be displayed on our website to support conclusions derived from machine learning models, as well as individual tweets as specific case studies.

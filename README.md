# COVID-19 Twitter NLP
### *HDAG Data Science Fellowship*

Our project aims to characterize the public opinion of the COVID-19 pandemic by applying machine learning on COVID-related tweets. Rather than access the Twitter COVID-19 streaming endpoint directly, we use the pre-curated [USC JIMR Dataset](https://publichealth.jmir.org/2020/2/e19273/#ref24). After tweet hydration, we use natural language processing tools to derive aggregate features from our dataset.
